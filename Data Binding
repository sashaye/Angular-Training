Interpolation is used to bind data from the component with the html with the use of the curly bracket {{ bindingVariable }}

- Displaying title in html as {{title}}
<h1> Welcome to {{title}}. </h1> 

- To loop through an array, we would use *ngFor 
*ngFor = “let i of months” and display i wihtin the curly brackets {{i}}
 <option *ngFor = "let i of months">{{i}}</option> 

- To display data base on a condition we would use *ngIf
If is used with the else condition and the variable used is condition1. 
The same is assigned as an id to the ng-template, and when the available variable is set to false the text Condition is invalid is displayed.

import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({ 
   selector: 'app-root', 
   templateUrl: './app.component.html', 
   styleUrls: ['./app.component.css'] 
}) 
export class AppComponent {
   title = 'New Angular Project'; 
   
   isavailable = false; //variable is set to true
   
   // declared array of months. 
   months = ["January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June", "July", 
      "August", "September", "October", "November", "December"];
}
